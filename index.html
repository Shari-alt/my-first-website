     <h2 id="Passion"> Passion </h2>
      <p> It's all about Passion - isn't it? </p>
      <p> So my passion is about people. I like to share stories with people, laugh together and having a nice time. <br>
            Sometimes it's good to see life and problems from different perspectives. <br>
            It's all about Yoga, my Dog and Coffee. And of course I need adventure.

      <h2 id="about"> About me </h2>
      <p> I'm Shari, 23 years old and currently making this web development bootcamp neueFische. <br>
          I always find it kind of hard to decide what I want to do with my life because there are so many nice things out there. <br>
          so my yearly goal is it to learn something new. It doesn't matter if it's a kind of sport or a language. <br>
          In my freetime I'm often find at the sea or on the sea going kitesurfing. <br>
          On other days you can find me climbing or doing Yoga. 
          In this year I'm also doing a Yoga Teacher Training - most important that life never gets boring! </p>

      <p> My Inspiration is defintely Coco Chanel. Just because she did Thing the way she wants to do it. <br>
          No matter what people are saying. So most important is to think with your heart and just do things. Don't overthink it. <br>
          What I have learned through the last years, also caused to a burn out, is 'LOVE IT, LEAVE IT OR CHANGE IT'

      <h2 id="Biography"> Biography </h2>
         <p> My Career path goes a little bit criss cross. <br> 
          After finishing school I worked as a skiing instructor for some months. <br> 
        Then I travelled to India to visit my family there. My trip continued to Australia, Thailand, New Zealand and Bali. <br> 
        I met so many nice people and had a very good time. 
        Then I moved to Bremen to study 'International Study of Appplied Leisure Science'. During this time I moved to Salzburg for half a year to make my exchange semester in 'Management of Tourism'. <br> 
        Because I felt in love with Austria I startet another study of 'Digital Business and Software Engineering'. But unfortunately it turned kind of hard to write my Bachelor Thesis and at the same time starting a new study. <br>
        So I quit this and worked as an Event Manager after finishing my Studies. <br>
        Now it's time to start a new chapter. That's why I startet my Yoga Teacher Training and this Web Development Bootcamp. <br>
        Let's see what life gives us next. </p>
